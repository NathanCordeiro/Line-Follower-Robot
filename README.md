# Line Follower Robot using Arduino Uno

This project demonstrates a line follower robot powered by an Arduino Uno. The robot uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and adjust its path accordingly by controlling the motors.

## Introduction
The line follower robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface. It uses five IR sensors to detect the line's position and adjusts its movements by controlling the left and right motors accordingly.

## Components
- Arduino Uno R3
- 2 DC Motors with motor driver
- 5 IR Sensors (individual or array chanel works)
- Motor driver (L298N or similar)
- Chassis, wheels, and other mechanical components
- Jumper wires (breadboard is optional)

## Circuit Diagram
[Insert an image or a link to the circuit diagram here]

## Code Explanation
The code is designed to:
- Read the values from five IR sensors.
- Determine the position of the line based on the sensor values.
- Adjust the motor speeds to follow the line correctly.

### Motor Control
- `motorRPin1`, `motorRPin2`, and `motorREnable` control the right motor.
- `motorLPin1`, `motorLPin2`, and `motorLEnable` control the left motor.

### IR Sensors
- The IR sensors are connected to analog pins A0 to A4.

### Functions
- `scanD()`: Reads the IR sensor values.
- `check()`: Determines the robot's movement based on the sensor values.
- `rightS()`, `leftS()`, `go()`, `stopme()`: Control the motors to turn right, turn left, move forward, and stop respectively.

## Inbuilt Functions
-  `analogWrite()`: Allows you to write a an analog value (a pulse-width-modulation wave) to a specific pin.
     ```INO
      Syntax:
      analogWrite(pin, value)
      Parameters:
      Pin - Pin to write to allowed to be an int only
      value -  The duty cycle, ranging from 0 to 255 
     ```
-  `digitalWrite()`:
-  `bitWrite()`:

## Usage
1. **Assemble the Hardware**:
   - Connect the IR sensors to the analog pins A0 to A4 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the motor driver to the Arduino and the motors.
   - Power the Arduino and motor driver.

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Upload the provided code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Run the Robot**:
   - Place the robot on a track with a black line on a white surface.
   - The robot will follow the line autonomously.
